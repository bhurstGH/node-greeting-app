1. What is a Node module?
A: A function or set of functions you want to make available to other people or programs, like a library.

2.What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?
A: exports is merely a reference to module.exports.

3. Why is using exports recommended?
A: It favors immutability. Since it is just a reference to module.exports, any reassignment does not effect module.exports itself. A bit like using something such as .map() does not effect the original array.
